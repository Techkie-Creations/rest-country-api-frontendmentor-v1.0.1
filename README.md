## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Bootstrap Components](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

There is not really anything to add to this, maybe additional filters but i do not see the use of them. So there will be no update on this maybe the CSS styling.
